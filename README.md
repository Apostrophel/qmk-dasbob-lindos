# DASBOB - Lindos Layout
This is my custom 3x6, 3 thumb cluster split keyboard layout.

## Layout
This layout uses home row mods in the GASC order, Mod-tap for the three thumb cluster buttons, and combos for various brackets.
Its a pretty efficient layout, minimising number of layers to keep track of. 

### Layers 
Other than the base layer with home row mods, there is the symbols/numbers layer (NUM) and the navigation layer (NAV).
